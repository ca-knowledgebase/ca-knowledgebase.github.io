## Amelia Gully
[Amelia Gully](https://ameliagully.com/), [@agully1](https://github.com/agully1) is a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Language and Linguistic Science at the University of York. Her work focuses on the acoustics of speech, and particularly how someone's vocal anatomy contributes to the uniqueness of their voice. She is a member of the [UKAN Computational Acoustics Special Interest Group](https://acoustics.ac.uk/sigs/computational-acoustics/) committee.

## Jonathan Hargreaves
[Jonathan Hargreaves](https://www.salford.ac.uk/our-staff/jonathan-hargreaves), [@jahargreaves](https://github.com/jahargreaves), is a Lecturer in Acoustic and Audio Engineering at the University of Salford. Most of his research focuses on computational acoustics algorithms, but he also has strong  interests in loudspeaker arrays, material characterisation, and microphone arrays. He teaches undergraduate and postgraduate courses on computational acoustics and is especially passionate about communicating its core concepts in accessible ways. Jonathan was awarded the UK Institute of Acousticsâ€™ Tyndall Medal for outstanding contribution to acoustics research and education in September 2016. He is a member of the [UKAN Computational Acoustics Special Interest Group](https://acoustics.ac.uk/sigs/computational-acoustics/) committee, the [EAA Technical Committee for Computational Acoustics](https://euracoustics.org/technical-committees/computational-acoustics/), and the IOA Research Coordination Committee.

## Nick Ovenden
[Nick Ovenden](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=NCOVE55) is a Professor of Applied Mathematics at University College London. He currently works on wave propagation in complex media, particulary media containing contrast agents such as coated microbubbles. Other research interests include outdoor sound propagation, biomedical applications and physiological modelling. He co-leads the [UKAN Computational Acoustics Special Interest Group](https://acoustics.ac.uk/sigs/computational-acoustics/)
