The _mesh_ is a representation of a domain by [unstructured elements](element-types) and how the mesh is set up is a major factor in how accurate a simulation will be.

* *Dimensionality*: will the mesh be set up in one, two or three dimensions? The more dimensions, the greater the computational cost of your model. If your model is regular or symmetrical, you may be able to exploit this to reduce the problem size.
