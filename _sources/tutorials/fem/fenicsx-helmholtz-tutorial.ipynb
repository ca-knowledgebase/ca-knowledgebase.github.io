    "# ### The Governing PDE\n",
    "#\n",
    "# #### The Helmholtz Equation\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The lossless wave equation reads:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# $$\n",
    "# \\nabla^2 p = \\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2}\n",
    "# $$\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Where $p = p \\left(\\mathbf{x},t\\right)$ is the unknown pressure disturbance field, in\n",
    "# Pascal. $p$ is defined in $\\overline{\\Omega} \\times T$ and has complex values. $c$ is\n",
    "# the phase speed of sound in the medium, in metres per second.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# We impose that the pressure field is a steady state harmonic field:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# $$\n",
    "# p = \\tilde{p} \\exp\\left(j\\omega t\\right)\n",
    "# $$\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Where $u$ is the unknown spatial part of the field. $u$ is defined in $\\overline{\\Omega}$\n",
    "# and has complex values. $j$ is the imaginary unit and $\\omega$ is the angular frequncy of\n",
    "# the field, in radians per second. If $\\nu$ denotes the frequency in Hertz we have:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# $$ \\omega = 2\\pi\\nu = kc$$\n",
    "#\n",
    "# With $k$ the wave number.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# By substituting into the wave equation we obtain the Helmholtz equation:\n",

    "# $$\n",

    "# ### The Weak Form\n",
    "#\n",
    "# We need to convert our PDE into a weak form to solve our problem with FEniCS. This is done\n",
    "# by recognising that $u$ is a vector of an appropriate Sobolev space. Then, another test\n",
    "# function $\\phi$ is taken from the Sobolev space, with the requirement of being $0$ on\n",
    "# $\\partial \\Omega$. Multiplication of the governing PDE with $\\phi$ and integration by parts\n",
    "# lead to the weak form. The weak form reads:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# $$\n",
    "# \\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\tilde{p}  \\cdot \\nabla \\phi^\\star d\\mathbf{x}\n",
    "# - k^2 \\int_\\Omega \\tilde{p}  \\phi^\\star d\\mathbf{x}\n",
    "# = \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1}\\int_{\\partial \\Omega_l} g_l \\phi^\\star ds\n",
    "# $$\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Where we simplified notation by dropping the functions arguments. $d\\mathbf{x}$ denotes the\n",
    "# volume element of $\\Omega$ while $ds$ denotes the surface element in $\\partial \\Omega$. $\\star$\n",
    "# denotes complex conjugation. Note that the equation above has the following form:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# $$\n",
    "# a \\left(u,\\phi\\right) = L\\left(\\phi\\right)\n",
    "# $$\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Where $a$ and $L$ are the bilinear and linear form respectively. FEniCS requires the specification of these two quantities.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# :::{note}\n",
    "# The Neumann boundary conditions feature directly in the weak form. The same goes for Robin\n",
    "# conditions. However, Dirchlet boundary conditions don't and are treated separately.\n",
